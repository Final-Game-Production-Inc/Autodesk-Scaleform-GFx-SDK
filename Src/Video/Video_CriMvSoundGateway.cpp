TIPS          :   THE TYPICAL REASON OF THIS PROBLEM IS:
					When Open A New Sample Like GFL2 Exilium .usm File, It Runs Extremely Slowly(Threads Problem)
					Cuz CRIWARE 2019 SDK Embbed And Support H.264 Encoded (Reference To sf_video_4.6.33_windows_msvc11_lib_4K-ready),
                    USE Sofdec2 Viewer Open It Fluently, But Scaleform Video Player Is Extremely Slow To Open It,
                    And When Open More H.264 Files, The GFxPlayer Is Crashed.

                    Should Be Fix It Is Requirments.

                    This Criware SDK Will Be Stop Update For Scaleform 5.0 (After 2030) Stable Version, And More Support To FFMpeg,
                    FINAL VIDEO(FINAL ENGINE), A SelectaVision HDRVIDEOS Persensation(.264-.268 File Format), And More Support Video As Everyone Seen.
